# NU CIF Capstone 
A Capstone project at the University of Nebraska-Omaha.  

We aspire to extend the functionality of [CIF version 4](https://github.com/csirtgadgets/verbose-robot/wiki/Introduction), a Cyber Threat Intelligence Management System, by adding an additional endpoint specific for Palo Alto firewalls.

## Features of Palo Alto Endpoint in CIF
#### Compliant to Palo Alto 
#### Paging
#### User Input Sanitization 

## Check Out the Feature Yourself
Checkout our [walk-through guide](https://github.com/neil-unomaha/CIF_CYBR_8950/blob/master/cif-install-walkthrough.md) where we talk through, step-by-step, how to setup CIF version 4, and how to plug in our feature.
