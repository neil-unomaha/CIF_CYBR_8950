# CIF Framework

## Executive Project Summary

### Goals and Objectives

* Familiarize ourselves with the CIF framework to better understand the system
* Setup sandbox environment with CIF
* Research Palo Alto documentation and other resources to better understand the API
* Look into using the Palo Alto API to automate any processes within the CIF framework
* Document key findings and processes that were attempted in the sandbox environment

### Merit

If we can effectively implement tools from the Palo Alto API to the CIF Framework, this will help to automate some of the processes within the system. This can remove some of the manual, tedious task(s) that must be done with the framework. With proper implementation, this could also eliminate risk associated with human error within the framework, as it would be done automatically. If deemed appropriate, this could also be shared with other colleges/organizations that utilize the CIF framework.

## Project Timeline

* Come up with task list and projected deadlines for said tasks
* Look at [ganttpro](https://ganttpro.com/) for making a planning chart

## Risk List

|Risk name  | Impact     | Likelihood | Description | Mitigation |
|-----------|------------|------------|-------------|------------|
|Sample name| 1-10 | 1-10 | Some description | How to avoid it |
| another example | 1-10 | 1-10 | Some description | How to avoid it|

## Project Methodology
- *Probably first do the research, set up test environment, get a feel of the environment, start testing Palo Alto API calls and document what worked and what didn't. Maybe start around there? Eventually try to set it up in a way that it can be applied in the field?*

### Literature Review and Research

#### Research Questions

* Is there a way to properly implement Palo Alto API to automate any processes within the CIF framework?
* Will implementing said API effectively be more efficient in the CIF framework?
* more stuff...........
