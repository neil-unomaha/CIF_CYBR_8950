# Literature and Research Material

### Process Automation Articles
J. K. Visser and H. T. Malan, “Identification of risk associated with process automation systems,” Int. J. Econ. Manag. Eng, vol. 13, no. 7, pp. 1044–1051, 2019. \
Keywords - Process Automation, Risk, System Performance, Third-Party Communication, Interface Compatibility \
This paper was a study that was sent to 172 instrument technicians and technology managers. This was to identify risk in process automation systems. The focused 5 areas of risk: lack of skilled technicians, integration of capability of the third-party system software, reliability of the process automation hardware, excessive costs pertaining to performing maintenance and migrations on the automation systems, and requirements of having third-party communication interfacing compatibility as well as real-time communication networks. This works addresses these problems and gives a conceptual framework in a way to follow to remedy these issues. \

### API Integration / Middleware for Connecting APIs
S. Chang-Woo, L. Daesung, C. Kyung-Yong, R. Kee-Wook, and L. Jung-Hyun, “Interactive middleware architecture for lifelog based context awareness,” Multimedia Tools and Applications, vol. 71, Jan. 2013. \
Keyword - Middleware, Centralized Storage, DBMS, Multiple Middleware, Mobile Devices, Logs \
This paper reference all the different forms of information being made today. There is a need for middleware to be able to obtain it from all sources and store it in a centralized location or DBMS. The research shows how effective middleware is an important issue that needs to be addressed. The paper goes on to address the distributed environment and how they communicate, and the middleware needed to allow a different type of hardware to talk. They talk about a lot of other work and explain there experiment fairly well for the common reader to understand. \

### Systems Architecture Integration
R. T. Tiburski, L. A. Amaral, E. D. Matos, and F. Hessel, “The importance of a standard security architecture for SOA-based IoT middleware,” Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, vol. 53, no. 12, pp. 20–26, Dec. 2015. \
Keyword – IoT, System Architecture, Middleware, Security, Standard Architecture \
This paper talks about integration into systems for IoT devices. It goes into detail about the middleware needed to monitor IoT devices on the systems. The paper reference how a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is useful for integration from new devices. After the discussion of SOA, it talks about the company using Resource-Oriented Architecture alongside the SOA to bring the benefits of IoT devices into a company infrastructure. Then the paper talks about the security risks that come with the IoT devices and ways to mitigate them. This paper is a good reference for System Architecture Integration examples because it shows how to bring IoT devices into the mix. \

### Web Services Literature
E. B. Fernandez, N. Yoshioka, and H. Washizaki, “Patterns For Cloud Firewalls” AsianPLoP (pattern languages of programs), pp. 1–11. \
Keyword - Firewalls, Security patterns, Network security, Cloud Computing, Services \
This paper gives a generalized view of different firewall configurations for single businesses and multiple businesses. They discuss how one firewall can filter traffic to one customer differently than it filters to another customer. By setting group rules for any traffic going to certain IP ranges or domains. They talk about in detail about cloud-based firewalls like amazon uses their firewalls and how they are configured. It gives a nice explanation of the configuration and how every business is a little different. The paper also talks about having multiple firewalls and each one does something different. Some firewalls only do security groups while others are for whitelisting. It gives detail on why the configuration is made like this and have a lot of good images to visualize this. \

### Dockerization Hardening
P. Ranaweera, V. N. Imirth, M. Liyanage, and A. D. Jurcut, “Security as a Service Platform Leveraging Multi-Access Edge Computing Infrastructure Provisions,” researchgate.net, pp. 1–7. \
Keyword – Security as a Service, Docker, Dockerization, Security, IoT \
This paper talks about docker as security as a service. They first talk about why they choose docker for this investigation was that it was lightweight and fairly secure in their default configuration. They all used edge cases to test the docker container for performance and to see how it would handle these. They found that docker was suitable for there test even when scraping and building the containers for an app it was relatively quick and effective. The end of the paper talking about optimizing security service provisioning. This was showing that using docker to launch multiple security instances is viable when date rates are increased. This helps to show the docker can be used securely in an organization. \

### CIF Literature
J. Elmellas, “Knowledge is power: the evolution of threat intelligence,” ScienceDirect, pp. 1–5, Jul. 2016. \
Keyword - CIF, Security, Threat Intelligence \
This paper starts by talking about threat intelligence and how the need for the collaboration came about the birth of the Collective Intelligence Framework. And how CIF can be used for IP, Autonomous System Numbers, email addresses, domain names, and URLs. The researcher talks about the ease that CIF allows for automating the use of dating being brought to it. The researcher goes into detail about using SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) Software to gather multiple tools logs and pass the correct data to the CIF. Then share it with others. He ends the paper talking about TAXII(Trusted Automated Exchange of Indicator Information) standard that is being adopted for the situation for multiple organizations to share information. \
