Keywords: application program interfaces, Web APIs, API consumer applications, web API integration, webservices
1.	Problem Statement: As Web APIs grow in complexity, so too does quantity and type of errors. At the time of this publication, no large scale evaluation has been conducted that identies and classifies all types of API errors that can happen.

2.	Research Question(s)
    - What types of faults are impacting API consumers?
    - What is the prevalence of these fault types, and how many API consumers are impacted by them?
    - What are the current practices and challenges to avoid and reduce the impact of problems caused by faultus in API integration?

3.	Contribution:
    - Classification of API faults
      - invalid user input
      - missing user input
      - expired request data
      - invalid request data
      - missing request data
      - insufficient permissions
      - double processing
      - configuration
      - missing server data
      - internal and third party
    - Recommendations for API providers and API consumers to reduce faults
4.	Rationale
By identifying beforehand all possible API errors a user might run into, it can facilitate good documentation and help developers develop good API design which helps prevent errors from occurring.

5.	Investigative Approach:

    - Evaluated error responses to a large scale webserve (Adyen webservices)
    - Evaluated 2.43 million error responses from the logs
    - Surveyed API consumers
6.	Lessons Learned:
    - Most faults are caused by the following:
      - invalid request data (received input that cannot be handled)
      - missing request data (consumer fails to send needed info required for action)
      - double processing (send same request to delete the same resource twice: second request produces a fault because the resource no longer exists)
    - Faults caused by the API provider and third parties are must impactful (those originating by end user: not so much)
      - API documentation is critical, followed by code examples
      - Provide common implementation scenarios (instead of merely stating the different options of the API calls)
      - Identify the most common API mistakes, and how to prevent them
      - Details on error codes

Keywords: application program interfaces, systematic mapping study, API documentation generation approaches, API documentation process, API documentation

1. Problem Statement
Maintaining API documentation is a burdensome task. Especially when code updates are frequent, documentation updates often get overlooked. Tools are required to aid in this process.

2. Research Question(s)
    - What approaches exist for creating new and improving existing API documentation?
    - How do the approaches contribute to API documentation?
    - What are the sources for API documentation?
    - What are the quality properties of the approaches?
    - How are the documentation approaches evaluated?

3. Contribution:
A representation of what the current literature in the domain of API documentation expresses is important in order to maintain up-to-date API documentation.

4. Rationale
Documentation is crucial. Without an authoritative source providing documentation for their code artifacts, users will turn towards the internet on crowd-sourced platforms where it is not guaranteed they will receive the best guidance.

5. Investigative Approach:
Conducted a systematic mapping study regarding various search terms related to APIs. They then analyzed the API documentation strategies discussed in those papers. Most approaches to

6. Lessons Learned:
The results from the study suggest that, if the quality of the API documentation is to be maintained: tools to generate the API documentation must be used. The study suggests that a significant amount of API documentation generation tools focus on producing natural language and code examples. This article thus postulates that these are the two areas that are most lacking in API documentation.
Major of papers reference tools, while others use plugins, but which ultimately produce templates which include natural language documentation and code examples.

Keywords - Cyber Threat Intelligence Capability, Super SEIM

This book services as guidance for successful development and implementation of cyber threat intelligence capability. It derives its conclusions from the personal observations of the author.
Two critical take aways:
- It is critical that business objectives are clearly defined so that the most appropriate cyber threat intelligence capability can be built.

- Threat Intelligence feed is different from data feed. Often intelligence is sold when in fact it is just data. Threat intelligence is data that has been vetted by some process or procedure and it satisfies three different requirements:
  - Relevant
  - Actionable
  - Valuable

Keywords: Collective Intelligence, Web 2.0 Applications

1.	Problem Statement: There is currently no applications specifically tailored to the special education sector. An information system needs to be designed surrounding special education data—one which ingests data from a variety of different contexts and settings. Data input must have good UX design so as to easily sift through data and to easily utilize the data to make strategic and informed decisions for the clients.

2.	Research Question(s):

    -  What is a design and implementation strategy for developing a special-purpose collective intelligence application within the domain of special education data?

3.	Contribution: There is value in using the collective intelligence model in the special education sector because data is often collected in silos. A single application that ingests data from all the different sources can identify patterns and make more informed decisions on future endeavors.
This paper identifies seven principle collective intelligence requirements:
    - Task specific representations
    - Data is the key
    - Users add value
    - Facilitate data aggregation
    - Facilitate data access
    - Facilitate access for all devices
    - The perpetual beta (continuous improvement)
4.	Rationale: Researchers claim that, at the time of this publication, there did not exist a tailored application to the special education sector.
5.	Investigative Approach: Developed over 18 month field trial with one student with autism. Started with a prototype and with feedback made tweaks and increased features over time.
6.	Lessons Learned: A collective intelligence model can be applied to many different contexts—likely any context where the aggregated information from various contexts all surrounding the same issue or problem can yield revealing insights.

Keywords: collective intelligence, Real-time systems, Decision making

1. Problem Statement: Aggregating individual opinion asynchronously, such as by polling, does not provide the opportunity for real-time collective intelligence to emerge.

2. Research Question(s)

    - What is the comparison of human swarming to that of decision making done asynchronously?
    - What are the critical components that yield successful human swarms?

3. Contribution: Software makes it possible to conduct real-time negotiation

4. Rationale: Various mechanisms in use can cause entrenchment, and polarizing view.  Hearding and snowballing effects are sometimes seen with existing mechanisms.

5. Investigative Approach: Baseline was using surveys to ask participants asynchronously two pilot studies: the weight of a cow in a picture, and the 2015 academy aware winners. They then did the same thing but with their human swarm software UNU

6. Lessons Learned:

    - Collective intelligence has sub categories.  
    - Collective intelligence such as polling is good for reviewing average sentiment and popular opinion, but it is not a mechanism for negotiation. In fact, polling can cause entrenchment.  
    - Designed software where each user controls a magnet on a puck,  The puck is in the center of the screen.  A question is asked, and the various options are at the edges of their screen.  They position their magnet to pull in their direction of their choice, but lots of people are doing this at the same time which reveals realtime feedback.  
    - Human swarming, a type of collective intelligence, can be more efficient, and even more accurate, than individual experts, or even traditional statistical means of using averages.

1. Problem Statement:
  - There are more and more network security threats, and an intrusion detection prevention system is one of the best ways to protect a network.
2. Research Questions:
  - Can a better IDPS system be created with available tools.
3. Contribution:
  - An intelligent and effective IDPS system has been created with multiple available tools.
4. Rationale:
  - That using current tools a better IDPS system can be created and implemented that protects a network.
5. Investigation:
  - Research many of the commonly used tools and integrate them into a single IDPS system.
6. Lessons Learned:
  - By using a variety of tools, new methods of discovering and mitigating threats can be created.
7. Implications for practice:
  - Integrating several disparate systems can create a new system that is more versatile and effective than any single system.
8. Implications for research:
  - It would be worthwhile to research combining different systems to achieve the most effective system for network intrusion detection and prevention.
