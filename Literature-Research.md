### Web Services Literature

E. B. Fernandez, N. Yoshioka, and H. Washizaki, “Patterns For Cloud Firewalls” AsianPLoP (pattern languages of programs), pp. 1–11. \
Keyword - Firewalls, Security patterns, Network security, Cloud Computing, Services \
This paper gives a generalized view of different firewall configurations for single businesses and multiple businesses. They discuss how one firewall can filter traffic to one customer differently than it filters to another customer. By setting group rules for any traffic going to certain IP ranges or domains. They talk about in detail about cloud-based firewalls like amazon uses their firewalls and how they are configured. It gives a nice explanation of the configuration and how every business is a little different. The paper also talks about having multiple firewalls and each one does something different. Some firewalls only do security groups while others are for whitelisting. It gives detail on why the configuration is made like this and have a lot of good images to visualize this. \

### Dockerization Hardening

P. Ranaweera, V. N. Imirth, M. Liyanage, and A. D. Jurcut, “Security as a Service Platform Leveraging Multi-Access Edge Computing Infrastructure Provisions,” researchgate.net, pp. 1–7. \
Keyword – Security as a Service, Docker, Dockerization, Security, IoT \
This paper talks about docker as security as a service. They first talk about why they choose docker for this investigation was that it was lightweight and fairly secure in their default configuration. They all used edge cases to test the docker container for performance and to see how it would handle these. They found that docker was suitable for there test even when scraping and building the containers for an app it was relatively quick and effective. The end of the paper talking about optimizing security service provisioning. This was showing that using docker to launch multiple security instances is viable when date rates are increased. This helps to show the docker can be used securely in an organization. \

### CIF Literature

J. Elmellas, “Knowledge is power: the evolution of threat intelligence,” ScienceDirect, pp. 1–5, Jul. 2016. \
Keyword - CIF, Security, Threat Intelligence \
This paper starts by talking about threat intelligence and how the need for the collaboration came about the birth of the Collective Intelligence Framework. And how CIF can be used for IP, Autonomous System Numbers, email addresses, domain names, and URLs. The researcher talks about the ease that CIF allows for automating the use of dating being brought to it. The researcher goes into detail about using SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) Software to gather multiple tools logs and pass the correct data to the CIF. Then share it with others. He ends the paper talking about TAXII(Trusted Automated Exchange of Indicator Information) standard that is being adopted for the situation for multiple organizations to share information. \

Keywords - Cyber Threat Intelligence Capability, Super SEIM

This book services as guidance for successful development and implementation of cyber threat intelligence capability. It derives its conclusions from the personal observations of the author.
Two critical take aways:
* It is critical that business objectives are clearly defined so that the most appropriate cyber threat intelligence capability can be built.
* Threat Intelligence feed is different from data feed. Often intelligence is sold when in fact it is just data. Threat intelligence is data that has been vetted by some process or procedure and it satisfies three different requirements:
  *	Relevant
  *	Actionable
  *	Valuable
