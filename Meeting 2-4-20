CIF Version 4 Notes
Current Status of CIF 4:
Brian has a cron job that each day it automatically copies the threats into a file. Brian is then manually taking those threats and adding them to CIF.

Wishlist:
He would like us to automate the process:

About every 15minutes, using the Palo Alto API, Pull from Palo Alto and Push it out to CIF to CIF.
Also go the other way: pull threats from CIF, and push them up to Palo Alto automatically.

Observation:
A wishlist item from Brian was to dockerize CIF, but this has already been done for version 4 (the links in the power point regarding CIF was for version 3)

Notes: Download CIF via Docker on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

I followed the directions at https://github.com/csirtgadgets/verbose-robot/wiki#the-easybutton
I DID have to create an account on Maxmind as suggested in the installation directions

I attempted to install CIF on Ubuntu 16.04 Desktop via docker but docker was unable to finish pulling the image from docker hub.
I went ahead and added the environment variables described in the installation direction to my .bashrc file and sourced it. It appears copy/paste isn’t possible with ubuntu server between the VM and the host
Once I was in an interactive shell for my container, I did install cifsdk as indicated here: https://github.com/csirtgadgets/verbose-robot/wiki/Where-do-I-start

After getting the docker image, I started it up in interactive terminal via:
docker exec -it verbose-robot /bin/bash

According to the docks, I should enter variables as described here:
https://github.com/csirtgadgets/verbose-robot/wiki/FAQ#searching-logs

The issue is that I need a text editor, and apparently this image doesn’t allow installing nano or VIM
